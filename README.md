# ICON Foundry Macros



## Requirements
* [Sequencer](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sequencer)
* [JB2A](https://jb2a.com/) (I'm using their Patreon version but I'm sure there are some alternatives on the free version)
* [Warpgate](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/warpgate) (not used on every macro but still a great addition)
* [Token Magic FX](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/tokenmagic) (same as warpgate)

## How to use these macros

These are macros, you just have to make sure the macro is marked as "script" instead of "chat".

However, you are welcomed to tear them appart, mix and match, butcher them into smaller or bigger pieces to fit your needs, thats how these were born in the first place! Most of these Mods have compendiums with examples, use those to quickly get something usable, and if you have something you want included, go ahead and ping me on the icon-resources channel on [Pilot NET](https://discord.gg/b8g49Bqf)!

## Send to chat

This can be useful to pair with the sequencer macros, making a full on ability that can be used, info will be sent to chat and then the animations will play out


```js
const html = `<your HTML here!>`;
const data = {
          user: game.user,
          speaker: ChatMessage.getSpeaker({actor}),
          content: html
        }
const message = ChatMessage.create(data);
```
